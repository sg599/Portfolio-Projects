***Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis***

*Project Overview*

This project explores the relationship between sleep health, stress levels, physical activity, occupation, and heart rate using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and statistical tests in Python. The goal is to identify key factors affecting sleep and stress, providing insights for improving well-being.

*Dataset*

The dataset includes various health and lifestyle metrics, such as sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity levels, stress levels, occupation, and heart rate. The data was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python.

*Installation & Requirements*

To run the analysis, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, numpy

*Usage*

- Run sleep_analysis.ipynb to perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- View Sleep_Health_Report.pdf for detailed findings in APA format.

*Key Findings*

- Sleep duration and physical activity are positively correlated (r = 0.86, p < 0.05).
- Stress and sleep quality have a strong negative correlation (r = -0.87, p < 0.05).
- Males have higher stress levels than females, while females report better sleep quality.
- Business & Healthcare professionals experience higher stress than Education & Law professionals.
- Higher stress levels are linked to increased heart rate, especially in females.
